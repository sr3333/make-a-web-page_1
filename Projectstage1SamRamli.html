					<div class="description">The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like <a href="http://www.google.com"> www.google.com</a>, their computer sends a <em><b>HTTP Request</b></em> to a <em><b>server</b></em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em><b>web browser</b></em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496" >This video </a> does a good job of explaining more. </div>

				<h3><b>HTML</b></h3>
					<div class="description">HTML stands for <em><b>HyperText Markup Language</b></em>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em><b>text content</b></em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video </a> gives a good overview.</div>

				<h3><b>Tags and Elements</b></h3>

					<div class="description">HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444"> This video </a> explains the distinction well.</div>

				<h3><b>Why Computers are Stupid</b></h3>


					<div class="description">Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</div>

				<h3><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b></h3>

					<div class="description">HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</div>

				<h3><b>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b></h3>

					<div class="description">The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on... </div>

				<h3><b>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes </b></h3>

					<div class="description">When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.</div>

				<h3><b>Text Editors (for programming)</b></h3>

					<div class="description">When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.</div>
